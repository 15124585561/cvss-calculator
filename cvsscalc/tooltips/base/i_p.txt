Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not
have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is
limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but
either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can
modify files within only a limited context or scope.
