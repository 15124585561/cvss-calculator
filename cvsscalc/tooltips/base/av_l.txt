A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either
physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally
exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and
local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo).
