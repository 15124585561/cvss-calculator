pecialized access conditions exist. For example:
• In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or
spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking).
• The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by
knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or
atypical actions.
• The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice.
• If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow.
