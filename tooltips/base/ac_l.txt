Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are
examples:
- The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users,
possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server).
- The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous.
- The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional
information gathering.
- The "race condition" is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).
